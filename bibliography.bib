	abstract = {We present a centennial review of the history of the term known as the cosmological constant. First introduced to the general theory of relativity by Einstein in 1917 in order to describe a universe that was assumed to be static, the term fell from favour in the wake of the discovery of the expanding universe, only to make a dramatic return in recent times. We consider historical and philosophical aspects of the cosmological constant over four main epochs: (i) the use of the term in static cosmologies (both Newtonian and relativistic); (ii) the marginalization of the term following the discovery of cosmic expansion; (iii) the use of the term to address specific cosmic puzzles such as the timespan of expansion, the formation of galaxies and the redshifts of the quasars; (iv) the re-emergence of the term in today's Lamda-CDM cosmology. We find that the cosmological constant was never truly banished from theoretical models of the universe, but was sidelined by astronomers for reasons of convenience. We also find that the return of the term to the forefront of modern cosmology did not occur as an abrupt paradigm shift due to one particular set of observations, but as the result of a number of empirical advances such as the measurement of present cosmic expansion using the Hubble Space Telescope, the measurement of past expansion using type SN 1a supernovae as standard candles, and the measurement of perturbations in the cosmic microwave background by balloon and satellite. We give a brief overview of contemporary interpretations of the physics underlying the cosmic constant and conclude with a synopsis of the famous cosmological constant problem.},

    abstract = "{We analyse the largest spectroscopic samples of galaxy clusters to date, and provide observational constraints on the distance–redshift relation from baryon acoustic oscillations. The cluster samples considered in this work have been extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at three median redshifts, z = 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5. The number of objects is 12 910, 42 215 and 11 816, respectively. We detect the peak of baryon acoustic oscillations for all the three samples. The derived distance constraints are rs/DV(z = 0.2) = 0.18 ± 0.01, rs/DV(z = 0.3) = 0.124 ± 0.004 and rs/DV(z = 0.5) = 0.080 ± 0.002. Combining these measurements with the sound horizon scale measured from the cosmic microwave background, we obtain robust constraints on cosmological parameters. Our results are in agreement with the standard Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model. Specifically, we constrain the Hubble constant in a ΛCDM model, \\$H\_0 = 64\_\\{-8\\}^\\{+17\\} \\, \\, \\mathrm\\{km\\} \\, \\mathrm\\{s\\}^\\{-1\\}\\,\\mathrm\\{Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\} \\,\\$, the density of curvature energy, in the oΛCDM context, \\$\\Omega \_K = -0.01\_\\{-0.33\\}^\\{+0.34\\}\\$, and finally the parameter of the dark energy equation of state in the wCDM case, \\$w = -1.06\_\\{-0.52\\}^\\{+0.49\\}\\$. This is the first time the distance–redshift relation has been constrained using only the peak of baryon acoustic oscillations of galaxy clusters.}",

	abstract = {We discuss the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) contribution to cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations due to the coherent rotational velocity component of electrons within halos. This effect produces a distinct dipole-like temperature distribution across the cluster and provides a promising way to measure the angular momentum distribution of gas inside clusters. Information obtained from such a measurement may provide new insights to the origin and evolution of angular momentum in hierarchical structure formation theory. For typical well-relaxed clusters of mass a few times 1014 M☉, the peak fluctuation is of the order of a few μK, depending on the rotational velocity and the inclination angle of the rotational axis. For clusters that had undergone a recent merger, the contribution to temperature fluctuations could be even larger. This dipole signature is similar to the one produced by lensed CMB toward galaxy clusters, although the lensing contribution spans a larger angular extent than the one due to rotational scattering, since the former depends on the gradient of the cluster potential. Since the lensing contributions toward clusters are aligned with the large-scale CMB gradient, when higher resolution observations toward clusters are combined with a wide-field CMB map, these two effects can be separated. An additional, but less important, source of confusion is the dipolar pattern produced by the moving-lens effect involving, again, the gradient of the cluster potential and the transverse velocity. The angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies produced by the halo rotation is expected to be smaller than those due to the thermal SZ and peculiar-velocity kinetic SZ effects.}
